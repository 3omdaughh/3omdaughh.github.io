		I don’t tie myself down to any one philosophical school, I just grab ideas from wherever they make sense and shape my own outlook. Existentialism, Absurdism, and Nihilism? Yeah, they played a big role in shaping how I see life, but I’m not boxed into any of them. I take what clicks and keep moving.
		<br><br>
		Honestly, the philosophy that shaped me the most is existentialism. I firmly believe that no matter where, when, or under what circumstances you find yourself, it’s on you to create meaning in your life. The universe doesn’t hand it to you on a silver platter; you have to carve out your own purpose, make your own story worth telling. At the end of the day, what’s the point of existing if you’re just another face in the crowd? Standing out, being something unique, that’s the real reason you’re here.

		I’ll wrap up this section with this quote, hope it drives my point home.
