While engaging in a controversial conversation with some "friends," someone interrupts and says,<br>- "Omda, you don’t seem like before. You ain’t the same Omda we knew back then."<br>Which one do you mean? Which version is in your mind? And why do you see that version is better than me now? This question carries an implicit meaning, and if you look at it from a scientific perspective, every person is not the same after even a single sleep.<br><br><h3>Scientifically</h3><br>With new optical techniques for imaging single connections between neurons called synapses, we can see constant turnover with new synapses being formed and others disappearing. This raises a puzzle. In the face of so much turnover, how do memories stay stable over so many years? This is a picture of one dendritic branch on a neuron, which receives inputs from other neurons. The synapses are on the spiny knobs coming off the dendrite. On the top, the dendrite was imaged before learning. The same dendrite is shown below after learning and after sleep. Multiple synapses that are newly formed together on the same branch are indicated by the white arrowheads. You are looking down into the brain of a live animal. This is really a fantastic new technique. Synapses are less than a micron in diameter. In comparison, a human hair is around 20 microns in diameter. This new technique allows us to see how learning changes the structure of the brain with a resolution that is near the limit of light microscopy. This illustrates that, intriguingly, you are not the same person you were after a night's sleep or even a nap. It is as if you went to bed with one brain and woke up with an upgrade. This is a better deal than you can get from Microsoft.<br><br>Shakespeare, the great English poet, already knew this. Here is Macbeth lamenting his insomnia. "Sleek that knits up the raveled sleeve of care, the death of each day's life sore labor's bath. Balm of her minds, great nature's second course, chief nourisher in life's feast". Here, Shakespeare is making an analogy between knitteth clothes and sleep that knits up the loose threads of experience and concerns during the day and weaves them into the tapestry of your life story.<br><br><br>So, there isn’t a person who stays the same forever. To be honest, I think my paranoia and fear of the future play a major role in this radical change within me, making me different from who I was yesterday.<br>What keeps you running in circles, like a rat on a wheel, can push you to do things you never imagined you would. Running from past trauma and the constant urge to change every deeply rooted idea about yourself—believing you're not good enough for anything—is unbelievably hard. Trust me, it leaves you unsure of where the truth lies.<br><br>But that’s the thing no one truly knows where the truth is. This uncertainty will drive you to try everything just to figure it out in your own way. And until you find it, you’ll become many different versions of yourself, shaped by new experiences and new people.<br>Anyway, enjoy every phase until you figure it out. Don’t blame yourself for anything you did in the past, and don’t blame the people who hurt you the most. Let go because if it comes back, the same things will happen again.<br>What you can control is within your hands, NOW<br><br>- "Omda, omda, yo bro what is wrong, r u lost in ur thoughts or smthin?"<br>= Nahh man I'm good, just remembered smthin'<br><br><br><span style="color:#808080"><i>Finished at Thu, Mar 20.2025</i></span>
