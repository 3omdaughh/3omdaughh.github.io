<P>
This question has been stuck in my head for as long as I can remember. Since I was a kid, I’ve always felt like I was playing catch-up—everyone around me seemed smarter, faster, just <b><i>better</i></b>.<br> No matter where I was, I felt like the underdog, the one who just couldn't keep up. And at some point, I hit this moment where I thought, like Drake said, <i><b>"Is there more?"</i></b> More to lose? Because, honestly, I had already lost everything—friends, childhood connections, even the people who knew me best. So what’s left? My life? My existence?
<br>
I keep circling back to the same question: <i><b>Why always me?</i></b> Why does it feel like every time I take a step forward, life pushes me two steps back?
<br>
Am I enough? Honestly, I still don’t have that answer. Although I feel like this doubt comes from old childhood traumas—ones I’ve overcome, but they’ve still left some scars. Hopefully, I can shake them off asap. But lately, I’ve got this gut feeling that there’s something out there waiting. What exactly? No clue. But hey, who knows? ┐⁠(⁠ ⁠˘⁠_⁠˘⁠)⁠┌

Hope I’m doin well.
