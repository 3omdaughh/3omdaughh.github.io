<p>This is a question that has been on my mind for so long time.  This question I asked myself since I was a little kid, always seeing other better than me smarter than me faster than me, always feeling like I am the loser in any  situation I'm in, and I reached a point in my life I felt like what Drake says "Is There More?"  to lose?, I lost all things around, I was like is there more to lose? I lost every thing, so what is next to lose! my life? my existence? <br> I often find myself asking the same question. <br> Why is it always me? Why do I always seem to be the one who is struggling? Why does it feel like I'm always taking one step forward and two steps back? <br> So am I enough? till now I didn't know the answer tbh, but in this phase of my life I feel like there is something out there, but who knows ┐⁠(⁠ ⁠˘⁠_⁠˘⁠)⁠┌. <br> Hope I'm doin well.
