I’ve had enough.<br>I’ve had enough of burnout, of failure, of unjustified depression.<br>I’ve had enough of guilt, of regret, of denial.<br>I’ve had enough of responsibilities, of mood swings, of people filled with deception and exploitation.<br>I’ve had enough of people, phases.<br>I’ve had enough of being alone and lonely, of emptiness, of academic stress, of stress in general.<br>I’ve had enough of your bullshit that never made sense, of your inconsistent minds.<br>I’ve had enough of nicotine, of paranoia, of overthinking, of being hyper-aware.<br>I’ve had enough of knowing too much about my surroundings, of my own intelligence, of my mind that never shuts up.<br>I’ve had enough of striving, of pushing so hard, of endless practice with no results.<br>I’ve had enough of feeling lost, of suicidal thoughts, of falling into existential crises.<br>I’ve had enough of battling MDD for so long.<br>I’ve had enough of hearing “You’re not living your age” or “Why are you thinking about that? You’re still too young.”<br>I’ve had enough of poverty, of being misunderstood, of being stuck in miserable situations.<br>I’ve had enough of chasing, of being chained, of thinking, of talking, of justifying myself.<br>I’ve had enough of alarms, of surprises, of constant downfalls, of repeating the same mistakes.<br>I’ve had enough of feeling out of control, of feeling like I’m running out of time.<br>I’ve had enough of self-doubt, of impostor syndrome, of self-hate, of sadness.<br>I’ve had enough of deadlines, of addictions, of my own consciousness constantly judging me.<br>I’ve had enough of trying to hold on to whatever is left.<br>I’ve had enough of losing people, of endless goodbyes.<br>I’ve had enough of being overwhelmed.<br><br>I’m still 19. Why the fuck am I thinking about all this shitty stuff?<br>Why am I always over-carrying?<br>Why are my dark thoughts invading and dominating everything?<br>I feel them spreading through my body.<br>Is it even me thinking, or something else?<br>It feels stronger than the last time — back in August 2023.<br>Is it the same MDD but in a reformed, reinforced shape?<br>His thoughts — they almost completely take over my mind.<br>Only tiny fragments of me are still processing normally.<br>I’m scared of having it again.<br>And I remember: he’s the one who made me distant.<br>He’s the one who kept pushing me every single day.<br><br>But… it’s growing inside me now.<br>And I don’t feel safe.<br>It’s taking over my body without any regard for the damage it’s causing.<br>I’m trying to cling to what’s left of myself, but I can’t.<br>It’s overpowering me, and I’m losing this battle.<br><br>Please don’t believe what he says.<br>He’s trying to dress up this disaster, make it seem fine.<br>He’s the one who’s “okay” — not me.<br>Please trust me.<br>I am still myself.<br>He says this is all for attention — complete bullshit.<br>Weak excuses.<br><br>Right now, I can barely control my hands.<br>I don’t even know if I’ll manage to publish this.<br>I don’t know what he really wants.<br>I don’t know if I’ll ever feel safe again.<br>His grip on me was so strong, it made me believe he was my only protection — but that’s not what true safety feels like.<br>Is he even changing my memories now?<br>I can’t tell if I’m truly safe, or if this is just another layer of his control.<br>Is this what safety is supposed to feel like?<br><br>I have a faint, distant memory of what real safety felt like.<br>Maybe he’s trying to convince me he’s protecting me?<br>Maybe I’m just overreacting?<br>Maybe it’s all for our shared benefit?<br><br>I remember trusting him before — his strength made me feel powerful too.<br>Am I tired of that power now?<br>Do I really want to end this?<br>Could I even end it if I tried?<br>Is it even necessary?<br><br>I guess if it’s not hurting me outright, maybe I can just let it be.<br>Thank you for keeping me safe, I suppose.<br>I’ll adapt to the depression.<br>I’m sure he knows how to manage it.<br>I trusted him once.<br>I’m choosing to trust him again.<br>Maybe he just needs more time.<br>I’ll trust the process.<br>I still believe he…<br><br><br><span style="color:#808080"><i>Finished at Sat, Apr 19.2025</i></span>
