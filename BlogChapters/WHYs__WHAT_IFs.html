Lately, I’ve been analyzing relationships from a more detached, almost mechanistic perspective, and the results have been… perplexing. It’s late, I can’t sleep, and my brain is stuck in a recursive loop of questions. So, let’s run a thought experiment.<br><br>Do we fundamentally need love/partner/soulmate, or is this just a psychological mechanism for reciprocity? If the entire construct revolves around mutual exchange sharing, caring, and receiving in return, then isn’t it simply an evolved form of social barter? Why, then, do we crave it on such a visceral level? If that’s the core function, wouldn’t any form of emotionally reinforcing companionship suffice? Is our attraction to specific individuals merely a byproduct of neural conditioning, an evolutionary hack designed to optimize survival and cooperation?<br><br>Now, let’s strip the system down to its base algorithms. If we could eliminate the neural circuitry responsible for attachment—bypassing oxytocin, dopamine, and all the chemical reinforcements, would the concept of love still hold any intrinsic value? Or is it purely an emergent property of social cognition? If communication is the primary driver, does that mean love is just a high resolution feedback loop ensuring emotional homeostasis?<br><br>And What if we could override all of this, disabling the need for external validation, would love still be relevant? Would altruism still make sense in the absence of attachment?<br><br>But at this point, these are just academic questions. The reality is, I can’t sleep. My cognitive load is maxed out, and yet, here I am, running simulations of every possible scenario. I’ve never been this preoccupied with another person before. Never. So why is this occupying so much processing power? Why am I in this state of suspended anticipation? And more importantly, why am I experiencing fear—an emotion I’ve historically dismissed as an irrational heuristic?<br><br>I’ve always functioned on impulse, indifferent to risk, immune to sentimentality. But now? Now <b>I care.</b><br><br>And what if my worst-case projection materializes? What then? How do I recalibrate? If, on the other hand, the optimal outcome unfolds, how does that alter my trajectory?<br><br>There’s no median probability here. No standard deviation. It’s a binary outcome—win or lose, all or nothing. And if the failure state actualizes… what’s the recovery protocol?<br><br>Never thought I’d find myself trapped in this kind of recursive existential subroutine—drowning in an infinite loop of WHYs and WHAT IFs, like a runaway process consuming all available bandwidth. Feels like a cognitive deadlock. I need an interrupt. Fast.<br><br><span style="color:#808080"><i>Finished at Sat, Mar 29.2025</i></span>
