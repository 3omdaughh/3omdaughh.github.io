	    Selecting a top three list is quite challenging for me because I'm constantly listening music.
	    <br>It's tough to pinpoint my absolute favorites, but I'll do my best.
	    <br>After thinking for about five minutes and reviewing my Last.fm account, I'll attempt to narrow it down.

	<h2>I) Risk ~ DizzyTooSkinny</h2>
	<br>
	This track is from another <b>Dimension</b>, If you know me well, you know what this track means to me.

	<h2>II) Nasiny ~ Mousv</h2>
	<br>
	Mousa is my favourite artist (I think it's very obvious xDD), anyway, nasiny one of mousv's track that makes you feel drunk even if you never seen weed before xD, this track really makes me so high, also its shitty drunky lyrics will make you sure about what I'm sayin' xD.

	<h2>III) Qesa Hazena ~ Mousv</h2>
	<br>
	I will not say anything more all I want to say I said in Nasiny xD.
