		Let's begin with my all-time favorite game. I think I've completed it more than seven time, I can't even remember the exact number xD ,the first time I played this game was in fifth grade, auughh this game holds a special place in my heart fr.
	    <br><br>
	    <h2>I) Watch Dogs II</h2>
	    <h2><img src="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftse1.mm.bing.net%2Fth%3Fid%3DOIP.wkKa0qNBBbkbSTb3nn8kLQHaK6%26pid%3DApi&f=1&ipt=f84d1fcb78d4fb431da4b749f4e713d0817cb7970f19add5ec26d0fd66b8d220&ipo=images" alt="Watch dog2 cover"></h2>
	    <br>

It's truly indescribable how much I adore this game and what it means to me. If I were to start talking about it, I feel like the conversation would never end.

	    <b>this game is better than sex fr.</b>

	    <h2>II) Assassins Creed Syndicate</h2>
	    <img src="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftse1.mm.bing.net%2Fth%3Fid%3DOIP.-OxrrPBxJ3eakA60J315_wHaHa%26pid%3DApi&f=1&ipt=ddbb2d315f8ea5c48de69f6c07e17c0645d5623e1e9c15d1b6773a14d848339e&ipo=images" alt="Assassins creed">
	    <br> 
It might seem unusual for someone who has played over 50 open-world games to claim that Assassin's Creed Syndicate is in their top 2 favorites. Nevertheless, I hold a deep appreciation for this game due to its intricate details, compelling characters, engaging storyline, captivating side missions, and the historical era it portrays.But for me this game was good af.

	    <h2>III) Shadow of mordor</h2>
	    <img src="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftse1.mm.bing.net%2Fth%3Fid%3DOIP.QZcNSFo6zBTcK0bXm15NegHaKe%26pid%3DApi&f=1&ipt=4fa8265e8afff077d2d92d8b6cd4f98a212f781f3043894f0a484c8835caef97&ipo=images" alt="Shadow of mordor">
	    <br> I recall the initial encounter with this game vividly, specifically the moment when I witnessed the skill of summoning your Ghost to aid in combat. I distinctly remember my reaction was being like that 'O'.
