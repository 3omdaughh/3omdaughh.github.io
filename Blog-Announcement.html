				      ===============================================================



				      <span style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">Hello-World!</span>
				      it's really good to me to announce that I will publish a personal-
				      blog, cause I wanted to do that bitchass blog year and half ago(skull,emoji)
				      but as usual I was like a pig playing league 24/7, so let's get started.


				<h2>
			More details about blog<i>(inspiration, initiation, etc..)</i></h2>
				      ===============================================================
				      <h3>
				Inspiration.</h3>
				      I genuinely inspired from <a href="https://512kb.club/">512kb-Club</a>. I realized that Js is 
				      useless shit if I want to do a blog website for me and put some 
				      info about me.
				      So, I decided to make a pure HTML, CSS website and be cool, simple
				      and sleek as I want.

				      Intention.
				      . Make it simple as much as I can.
				      . Be less than 10kb.
				      . Use pure HTML, CSS without frameworks, JS shit.
				      . Do all work between exams days(just joke).

				      <h3>
				Initiation.</h3>
				      I started by seeing other people blogs to get inspired from that all,
				      then put my [3omda-ughh] signature, finally end up with a badass
				      website.
				      TBH I extremely sparked from a dear friend to me(his blog <a href="https://tokiesan.github.io/">here</a>)
				      and other german guy I know from reddit.
				      I merged his blog with tokhy blog and out with mine.

				      <h3>
				Execution.</h3>
