	    <h2>Hello-World!</h2>
I'm thrilled to announce that I'll be launching my personal blog. I had intended to start this blog a year and a half ago, but I consistently delayed it, largely due to being engrossed in playing league 24/7, but now it's time to embark on this new journey!
<br><br><hr>
<h3>More details about blog<i>(inspiration, initiation, etc..)</i></h3>
<h4>Inspiration.</h4>
I'm genuinely inspired by <a href="https://512kb.club/">512kb-Club</a>.I realized that Js is useless shit if I want to create a personal blog. 
Additionally, I preferred to avoid employing frameworks due to their excessive complexity and limited utility. Moreover, I aim for the entire system to remain straightforward for ease of maintenance.
<br>
So, I decided to make a pure HTML, CSS website and be cool, simple and sleek as I want.
<br><br>
<b>Intention.</b>
<ul>
  <li>Make it simple as much as I can.</li>
  <li>Be less than 10kb.</li>
  <li>Use pure HTML, CSS without any framework or JS.</li>
  <li>Do the whole website between exams days (just joke xD).</li>
</ul>
<br><br><hr>
<h4>Initiation.</h4>
I began my journey by exploring various blogs for inspiration, drawing insights from them all. Subsequently, put my [3omda-ughh] signature, after all end up with me creating this badass website.
<br>
TBH I extremely sparked from a dear friend to me called tokhy (love u bro <3)  and other german guy I know from reddit. I merged his blog with tokhy blog and out with mine.
<br>
Furthermore, I opted for GitHub Pages due to its simplified deployment process.
<br>
After completing the aforementioned steps and testing it out, everything is functioning smoothly. Later on, as I pondered a more convenient approach to compose my blog posts, the realization struck that crafting an entire HTML file from scratch for each post demanded considerable effort. 
<br>
 and you know my laziness, and that will make posting a single blog seem impossible for me xD. So what I do was creating a C program that take only title and content from me and he do all the work for me.
<br>
This idea is really good to me cuz this will make doing blogs easier and easier.
<br><br><hr>
<h4>Execution.</h4>
I've accomplished every goal, and the uncompressed size of the website's foundation was just 9KB. Used only HTML, CSS.
<br><br>
Honestly, it was enjoyable. I dedicated an hour each day over the last two weeks to work on a portion of this task. I'm genuinely pleased with the project; it achieved its straightforward goal.
<br>
I don't think I will do lots of changes to this website, maybe what I will do is to write some blogs and share them with some real Homies.
<br>
Finally, if you want to see the source code you can find it <a href="https://github.com/3omdaughh/3omdaughh.github.io">here</a>.
<br>
And have a nice day :D.
