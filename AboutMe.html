I'm a 18 y.o Egyptain, CS student who has a strong passion for technology and love digging into the details of anything related to this topic.
<br><br>
I'm a Sagittarius if you care about that stuff.<br>
I'm an ENTP person who loves to play league of legends, especially love to play sylas, yone, yasuo, sett, kayn and veigo,I really love these dudes more than some real homies.
<br><br>
I wish I have more time to play league every day (lying)

However, let's talk about me for real xD.

			<h2> What I plan to</h2>
I do not like to talk about what I want to do or what I plan to, or share any of my willingness with any body but I will talk about the crust of them with you.
<br><br>
<hr>
<h2> Software I use</h2>
<h3> I use <s>Arch</s> Manjaro Linux.</h3>
The switch I do from windows to linux was a very good step, and that is the first distro I use and it is really good smooth, soft, easy to use and at the same time a good distro to learn.
<br> and the next distro I will switch to is Arch, ASAP.
				      
<h4> Why Linux? Especially Manjaro?</h4>
<b>Fisrtly, let's answer the first question, Why linux?</b>
<br><br>I do not like someone tell me what is the best for me (windows) and every fucking two weeks suddenlly a random fucking update out of no where, and then what is the return from update, nothing you don't even know what the update do you really don't give a fuck that one of many reasons why I hate windows and make me switch to linux.
<br>but in linux especially the rolling release distros you always will be in the latest and greatest, only one command and all things done
<br><br>
<b>Then, Why Manjaro?</b>
<br><br>
When decided to switch to linux, I want to use arch as a main OS for my laptop but I heard it is a hard one to use and not for beginers so I found manjaro a fork from arch so I used it to learn more about linux before switch to arch.
