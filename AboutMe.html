I'm Sagittarius if you care about that stuff.<br>
I'm an ISTP person who loves to play league of legends, especially love to play sylas, yone, yasuo, sett, kayn and viego,I really love these dudes more than some real homies.
<br><br>
I wish I have more time to play league every day (lying)

However, let's talk about me for real xD.

			<h2> What I plan to</h2>
I do not like to talk about what I want to do or what I plan to, or share any of my willingness with anybody but I will talk about the crust of them with you.
<br><br>
<hr>
<h2> Software I use</h2>
<h3> I use <s>Arch</s> Manjaro Linux.</h3>
The switch I made from Windows to Linux was a very good step. It's the first distro I've used, and it's remarkably smooth, user-friendly, and ideal for learning.
<br>The next distro I plan to switch to is Arch, ASAP.
				      
<h4> Why Linux? Especially Manjaro?</h4>
<b>Fisrtly, let's answer the first question, Why linux?</b>
<br><br>I dislike having someone dictate what's best for me, such as Windows with its frequent and unexpected updates every two weeks. The lack of clarity on the purpose of these updates is bullshit, what do you gain from the update? you really don't give a fuck at all.
<br>n Linux, especially with rolling release distros, staying up-to-date is effortless â€“ just one command and everything is taken care of.
<br><br>
<b>Then, Why Manjaro?</b>
<br><br>
When making the decision to transition to Linux, I aimed to adopt Arch as my laptop's Main OS. However, due to its reputation for complexity, especially for beginners, I discovered Manjaro, a fork from Arch. Opting to use Manjaro first, I viewed it as a stepping stone to enhance my understanding of Linux before making the eventual switch to Arch.
