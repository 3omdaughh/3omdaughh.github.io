I'm a 19-year-old Egyptian CS student, totally hooked on tech and always diving deep into the nitty-gritty of it. I read what I could, deduced what I couldn't.
<br><br>
I'm Sagittarius if you care about that stuff.<br>
I'm an ESTP 8w7 person living day-to-day often facing random twists and turns out of nowhere, reaching unexpected highs, only to be brought back down, feeling as if nothing new has really changed. But, looking back I realize that a noticeable shift has actually taken place.
<br><br>
If you want to know more about my perspective of life go <a href="Philosophy.html">Philosophy</a> to see the world from my eyes. Wanna know how <a href = "https://www.instagram.com/3omdaughh/">Cool</a> I am?.

			<h2> What I plan to</h2>
I rarely talk about my ambitions or plans—it's just not something I share easily. But, I’ll give a glimpse into my perspective.
<br>I’m a cautious, almost paranoid person, especially when it comes to thinking about the future. With the way things are going, it’s hard to see anything as truly secure; everything seems to be spiraling from bad to worse. So, when people ask about my plans, the truth is that my goal is simple yet essential: to create an escape route for myself, to carve out a better place where I’m surrounded by people I care about, away from this bleak environment. To get there as fast as possible, I’m putting in the work.
<br><br>

<h2> Software I use</h2>
For my daily use I use almost 3 totally different softwares for 3 different devices, 2 laptops 1 tablet.
<br>
Let's start with the one that I spend most of my time with.
<h3>Latitude E5470</h3>
Is my main device that I run <b>Arch Linux</b> on it as my main operating system, and I use this device for studying, coding, all my academic staff, etc...<br>
You may ask why <b>Arch</b> specifically?. so when I choose operating system to use as my main one it was based on several points:
<ul>
  <li>Kernel + core utils. NO PROGS. <b>(Base Image)</b></li>
  <li>Open Source and Free</li>
  <li>No Corp.</li>
  <li>Does Not change UI/Look/Workflow</li>
  <li>Does Not update and upgrade</li>
  <li>Does Not Control Me</li>
  <li>Customizable</li>
  <li>Minimal Rolling Release</li>
  <li>Easy to use <b>(Does Not mean easy to learn*)</b></li>
</ul>
Each point of them may take lots of pages to talk about so I mentioned the headlines only
<br>
I think now you just figured it out why I choosed <b>Arch</b> cuz it is satisfied all points, and also I did not have any problems with <b>systemD</b> (till now) so it is all fine for me to use it instead going to <b>void</b>.
<br>
And I use it with some powerful tools like suckless tools <b>dwm, dmenu, st</b>, the point of choosing them is trying to <strong><i>minimalise</i></strong> storge, cpu and memory load, making my workflow <strong><i>faster and  more efficient</strong></i>.
<br>
<h3>Ideapad 3</h3>
This is my second device, which I use regularly. I have Windows installed on it for specific reasons, such as using tools and applications like Photoshop when needed for work or other purposes. Additionally, I use it occasionally to play League of Legends.<br>
<h3>Galaxy Tab A 10.1</h3>
This is the third and last device I use consistently. It is my school device, which I use exclusively for educational purposes, such as reading documents, accessing textbooks while studying, and similar tasks.
<br>
I’m also considering switching its operating system from Android to GrapheneOS, both for the experience and to enhance its security.<br>
<br>
Anyway. That is a summary for all lets deg deeper now.
<br><br>
<h3>Suckless tools</h3>
In an effort to minimize the use of my laptop's CPU and memory, I opted against using desktop environments such as Gnome, KDE Plasma, or even Xfce. Instead, I chose to implement a tiling window manager, specifically utilizing the X server with dwm, st, and dmenu, along with other efficient suckless tools. This decision was primarily driven by their simplicity and effectiveness. My system configuration is intentionally minimalistic, as I prioritize functionality over aesthetic customization. I rely solely on the terminal and dwm as my window manager, with dmenu to streamline certain tasks. Consequently, I have only applied a few necessary patches tailored to my specific use cases, aligning with my primary objective for using this operating system.
<br><br>
<h3>vim</h3>
When it comes to talking about the software I use, I think the first thing to mention is Vim. In short, I spend most of my day using it and doing a lot of great stuff. 
<br>To see my vim config you can reach it here <b>.vim/vimrc</b> in my dotfiles.
<br><br>
<h3>sxhkd</h3>
For managing my system key bindings, I use <b><i>SXHKD</i></b>. If you don't know what <b><i>SXHKD</b></i> is, it's basically an X daemon that executes commands based on input events. This makes it pretty easy for me to do some things faster and execute scripts just by pressing a key. The integration between <b><i>SXHKD</b></i> and other tools in my system, like dmenu and xclip, provides me with a really powerful tool and improves my workflow.
<br>
If you want to have a look to my key bindings you can reach it here <b>.config/sxhkd/sxhkdrc</b> in my dotfiles.
<br><br>
<h3>xclip</h3>
As anticipated, I utilize <b>xclip</b> as the clipboard manager for my system. For those unfamiliar, <b>xclip</b> is a command-line interface for X selections. I find it incredibly useful, especially when combined with <b>dmenu</b>, as it enables me to perform a variety of tasks efficiently.
<br><br>
<h3>vim-LaTeX-zathura</h3>
By combining these three tools, I've created a powerful solution for summarizing my lectures and managing my academic work. In essence, I use these tools for studying and taking notes.
<br>
You can find the source code for my plugins in the <b>.vim/ftplugin/tex.vim</b> file within my dotfiles. I wrote all these plugins myself. While there are many better options available online, I created them specifically to meet my needs and to be as minimal as possible, aligning with my goal of using the OS as I mentioned earlier.
<br><br>

	Looks like you find the under construction spot xDDD
	<h3>nnn (FZF)</h3>
	NNN, FZF 
	<br><br>

<h3>GnuPG (GNU Privacy Guard)</h3>
GnuPG is my go-to for locking down everything—emails, photos, backups—because privacy is just common sense. No shady middlemen, no bloated software, just pure control. I trust math over people, and encryption keeps my data mine.
<br><br>
<h3>LibreOffice <i>(Docx, pptx, etc..)</i></h3>
I use LibreOffice for my documents, but I don't use it to write DOCX files or create PDFs. Instead, I rely on Vim, LaTeX, and Zathura, as I mentioned earlier.
