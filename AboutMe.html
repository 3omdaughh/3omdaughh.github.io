			About Me</h1>
				      ===============================================================
				      <p style= "text-align: justify; font-size:16px;">
				      I'm a 18 y.o Egyptain, CS student who has a strong passion for 
				      technology and love digging into the details of anything related
				      to this topic.

				      I'm Sagittarius if you care about that stuff.
				      I'm an ENTP person who loves to play league of legends, especially
				      love to play sylas, yone, yasuo, sett, kayn and veigo,I really
				      love these dudes more than some real homies.
				      
				      I wish I have more time to play league every day (lying)

				      If you want to know more about me, go <a href="WIDU.html">WIDU</a> (what I do usually).

				      If you're interested in knowing more about the procedures I 
				      follow for creating this blog <a href="Blog-Announcement.html">Here</a>. 

				      However, let's talk about me for real xD.



				      ===============================================================

				<h2>
			What I plan to</h2>
				      ===============================================================



				      I do not like to talk about what I want to do or what I plan to,
				      or share any of my willingness with any body but I will talk
				      about the crust of them with you.



				      ===============================================================
				<h2>
			Software I use</h2>
				      ===============================================================
				      <h4>
				      I use <s>Arch</s> Manjaro Linux.</h4>
				      The switch I do from windows to linux was a very good step,
				      and that is the first distro I use and it is really good smooth,
				      soft, easy to use and at the same time a good distro to learn.

				      and the next distro I will switch to is Arch, ASAP.
				      <h4>
				      Why Linux? Especially Manjaro?</h4>
				      Fisrtly, let's answer the first question, Why linux? 
				      I do not like someone tell me what is the best for me (windows)
				      and every fucking two weeks suddenlly a random fucking update 
				      out of no where, and then what is the return from update, nothing
				      you don't even know what the update do you really don't give a fuck
				      that one of many reasons why I hate windows and make me switch 
				      to linux

				      but in linux especially the rolling release distros you always 
				      will be in the latest and greatest, only one command and all things done

				      Then, Why Manjaro?
				      When decided to switch to linux, I want to use arch as a main OS 
				      for my laptop but I heard it is a hard one to use and not for beginers 
				      so I found manjaro a fork from arch so I used it to learn more
				      about linux before switch to arch.

				      <h4>
				      Text Editor</h4>
				      I personally use vim and I really love its simplicity

				      <h4>
				      Music Player</h4>				      Spotify 

				      <h4>
				      Vedio Player</h4>				      VLC 

				      <h4>
				      Documents <i>(Docx, ppt, etc..)</i></h4>	      			      LiberOffice
