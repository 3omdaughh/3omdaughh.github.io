I'm a 20-year-old Egyptian CS student, totally hooked on tech and always diving deep into the nitty-gritty of it. I read what I could, deduced what I couldn't.
<br><br>
I'm Sagittarius if you care about that stuff.<br>
I'm an ENTP 8w7 person living day-to-day often facing random twists and turns out of nowhere, reaching unexpected highs, only to be brought back down, feeling as if nothing new has really changed. But, looking back I realize that a noticeable shift has actually taken place.
<br><br>

			<h2> What I plan to</h2>
I rarely talk about my ambitions or plans—it's just not something I share easily. But, I’ll give a glimpse into my perspective.
<br>I’m a cautious, almost paranoid person, especially when it comes to thinking about the future. With the way things are going, it’s hard to see anything as truly secure; everything seems to be spiraling from bad to worse. So, when people ask about my plans, the truth is that my goal is simple yet essential: to create an escape route for myself, to carve out a better place where I’m surrounded by people I care about, away from this bleak environment. To get there as fast as possible, I’m putting in the work.
